# MultiProcessor Programming Algorithm (Rust version)
This project contains most of the multiprocessor programming algorithm from *The Art 
of Multiprocessor Programming* implemented in Rust. 

Note that I use one binary crate for
one algorithm, in which I implement the algorithm as functions or as module (if the 
implemention is too complex) and main function as simple test. So this project is only for 
studying and understanding multiprocessor programming algorithm, but is **NOT** a library 
crate suitable for using.

In every folders, there will be a README as a brief introduce of the algorithm containing my 
own understanding. I just treat it as my own notes, so don't be too serious about it.

I'll be happy if any other one experienced in multiprocessor programming can give me your 
kind comment.
